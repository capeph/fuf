Objects:

Objects consists of a series of declarations.
Declarations have no individual order
Declarations all have an identity.
An identity can only be used once in each object - redefinitions are not allowed
There can be one declaration without identity in an object
The value is returned when an identifier is used
An identifier can be a name or a pattern of names and arguments
The value of the unidentified declaration is returned if no other pattern is provided
Objects are based on other objects, using them as prototypes
Values and metods of the prototype can be replaced
